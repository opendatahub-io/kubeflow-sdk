# Development Workflow for AI Agents

**Preferred commands**: use `uv run ...` to ensure tool consistency and `.venv` usage

**Before making changes**:

1. Read existing code patterns and docstrings for alignment
2. Follow [core-principles.md](core-principles.md)
3. Run validation commands before proposing changes

**Validation before proposing changes**:

- Lint/format: `make verify`
- Tests: `make test-python` or targeted `pytest` invocations
- Type checking: `uv run mypy kubeflow` (if available)

**Commit/PR hygiene**:

- Follow Conventional Commits in titles and messages
- Include rationale ("why") in commit messages/PR descriptions
- Do not push secrets or change git config
- Scope discipline: only modify files relevant to the task; keep diffs minimal
